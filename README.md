The Gray Verdict
Where nothing is black or white, and every side is heard

The Gray Verdict is a web-based debate learning game built for school and college students. It transforms core debate concepts—like logical reasoning, fallacies, burden of proof, and argument framing—into structured, gamified experiences. The project addresses Hackathon Track A’s goal of making debate practice easy, engaging, and educational.

The game includes five core modules: a debate simulator (The Arena), fallacy detection (Fallacy Hunt), argument construction (Frame the Flame), burden analysis (Burden Brawl), and trial-based scoring (The Verdict Room). Each module is designed to develop specific reasoning skills through interactive challenges.

Progression is tracked using XP, levels, and performance reports. Users receive real-time or turn-based feedback, can monitor their learning history, and unlock new content based on progress.

Built with React and Firebase, the platform is fully responsive, mobile-first, and ready for deployment. It supports structured gameplay logic, user accounts, leaderboard tracking, and real-time data sync.

This project is aimed at individual learners, schools, and debate clubs. It is designed to be accessible, intuitive, and effective for learners at all levels.
